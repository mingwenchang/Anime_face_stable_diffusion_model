**What are stable diffusion models**  

Stable diffusion models are state-of-art deep generative models in the machine learning field. They are capable of generating photo-realistic images from latent space and have been gaining significant attention in the past several years. Many famous generative AI websites [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F), etc are based on the technique of stable diffusion models 


**What is the goal of this notebook**  
  
In this notebook, I tried to build an ***unconditional*** denoising diffusion model from scratch and used the model to generate anime faces.    


**Anime faces generated from latent space:**

My codes and results are shown below.
